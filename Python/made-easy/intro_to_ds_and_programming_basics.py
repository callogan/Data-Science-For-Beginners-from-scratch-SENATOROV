"""Introduction to Data Science and Programming basics."""

# Data science facilitates decision-making, pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and data visualization. It enables us to:
#
# - Uncover critical questions and determine the primary causes of problems.
# - Detect patterns within raw data.
# - Prepare models for predictive analysis.
# - Present findings effectively through graphs, dashboards and etc.
# - Ensure for machines the ability to be capable in sense of intelligence.
# - Assess customer sentiment and refine recommendations.
# - Accelerate business development by enabling faster and more informed decisions.
#
# **Components of Data Science**
# - Data Mining.
# - Data Analytics.
# - Data Engineering.
# - Visualization.
# - Statistical Analysis.
# - Artificial Intelligence targets the creation of machines that imitate human actions. It dates back to Alan Turing's early work in 1936 but so far cannot substitute a human totally. 
# - Machine Learning extracts knowledge from data, by the following means: training with a teacher or training without a teacher.
# - Deep Learning uses multi-layer neural networks to cope with complex tasks where traditional Machine Learning is useless.
# - Big Data involves dealing with vast amounts of often unstructured data, requiring tools and systems designed to handle heavy workloads efficiently.
#
# **A data scientist extracts key findings from business data by taking these actions:**
#
# - Ask appropriate questions to understand the problem.
# - Garner data from multiple sources (enterprise, public, etc.).
# - Process raw data and turn it into manageable format.
# - Use Machine Learning algorithms or statistical models for insights.
# - Submit to stakeholders key findings for management needs.
#
#
# **Key skills for success in Data Science:**
#
# - Programming: Proficiency in Python or R is essential, where Python is deemed the preferred choice due to its simplicity and extensive libraries.
# - Statistics: A solid grasp of statistical concepts is crucial for deriving meaningful insights from data.
# - Databases: Expertise in managing and retrieving data from databases is fundamental.
# - Modeling: Mathematical models facilitate predictions and aid in selecting the most effective Machine Learning algorithms.
#
# **What is Programming?**
#
# Programming is the way of the communication with the computer. It is defined by specific, sequential instructions. Simply put, it transforms ideas into step-by-step commands that a computer can process. These structured instructions are known as an algorithm.
#
# **Computer Algorithm**
#
# In computer systems, an algorithm is a logical sequence written in software by developers to process input and generate output on a target computer. An optimal algorithm delivers results more efficiently than a non-optimal one. Like computer hardware, algorithms are regarded as a form of technology.
#
# **What is a programming language?**
#
# To communicate instructions to a computer, we use programming languages. There are hundreds of them, each with its own rules (syntax) and meanings (semantics), much like human languages. Just as words can have different spellings and pronunciations across languages, the same message is expressed differently in various programming languages.
#
# No matter which programming language you choose, the computer does not understand it directly. Instead, it processes Machine Language, which consists of complex numerical sequences. Writing in machine language is challenging, which is why programming languages are considered high-level — they are closer to human languages. An explanation, how high-level languages are translated into machine language, is described below.
#
# **What is Source Code and how to run it?**
#
# Source code is the set of instructions programmers write in various programming languages. It is written in plain text without any formatting like bold, italics, or underlining. This is why word processors such as MS Word, LibreOffice, or Google Docs are not suitable for writing source code. These tools automatically add formatting elements like font styles, indentation, and other embedded data, which prevents the text from being pure code. Source code must consist solely of actual characters.
#
# There are three main ways to convert source code into machine code:
#
# * Compilation;
# * Interpretation;
# * A combination of both.
#
# A compiler is a program that converts the source code to the machine code.
#
# An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming language,
# without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.
#
# Comparison between Compiler and Interpreter:
#
# - Compiler: Translates the entire code in one go.
# - Interpreter: Executes the code one line at a time.
# - Compiler: Produces a standalone executable machine code file.
# - Interpreter: Runs the code directly without generating a separate file.
# - Compiler: Once compiled, the source code is not needed.
# - Interpreter: The source code must be available every time it runs.
# - Compiler: Executes faster because the code is precompiled.
# - Interpreter: Executes more slowly as it translates the code during runtime.
