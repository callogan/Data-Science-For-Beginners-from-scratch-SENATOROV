    "- IPython Console – Enables interactive execution and real-time code testing.\n",
    "- Integrated Debugger – Helps in efficiently identifying and fixing errors within the code.\n",

    "- Addition (+) → a + b → Adds two numbers.\n",
    "- Subtraction (-) → a - b → Subtracts the second number from the first.\n",
    "- Multiplication (*) → a * b → Multiplies two numbers.\n",
    "- Division (/) → a / b → Performs division and always returns a float.\n",
    "- Floor Division (//) → a // b → Divides and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result (rounds down).\n",

    "- Multiplication (*) → a * b → Multiplies two numbers (e.g., 3 * 4 = 12).\n",
    "- Exponentiation ()** → a ** b → Raises the first number to the power of the second (e.g., 3 ** 4 = 81).\n",
    "4. In Python, a statement is a single line of code that executes a specific action, defining the logic,        operations, or control flow within a program.\n",
    "5. A variable in Python is a named reference that stores a value. The = operator is used to assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "6. No, a variable cannot be named \"import\" in Python because \"import\" is a reserved keyword used for importing modules.\n",
    "7. No, the statement is incorrect. Python is case-sensitive, meaning \"math\", \"Math\", and \"MATH\" are treated as distinct identifiers.\n",

    "    x, y, z = flowers\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "9. A syntax error occurs when the Python interpreter fails to understand the code due to structural issues, such as missing colons, parentheses, or incorrect indentation. In contrast, a semantic error happens when the code executes without crashing but produces incorrect or unintended results due to logical mistakes.\n",
