    "- IPython Console – Enables interactive execution and real-time code testing.\n",

    "6. No, a variable cannot be named \"import\" in Python because \"import\" is a reserved keyword used for importing modules.\n",
    "7. No, the statement is incorrect. Python is case-sensitive, meaning \"math\", \"Math\", and \"MATH\" are treated as distinct identifiers.\n",
